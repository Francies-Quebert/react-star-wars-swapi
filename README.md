# Star Wars React Application

This is a React application that allows users to explore information about Star Wars using data from the public API provided by [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/). The application consists of a home page and a list page, where users can filter and view details about various elements from the Star Wars universe, including people, planets, vehicles, and more.

3. **Filtering**: On the list page, users can filter the elements based on specific criteria. For example, when viewing the list of people, they can filter by name, gender, or any other relevant attribute.

4. **View More**: When users find an element of interest, they can click on the "View More" button to see the full details and additional information about that element.
